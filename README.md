# automate_backup
Simple script to automate backup configuration on many device by using loop on IP / Port.

It currently run by looping through Port on "devices.txt". It can be changed on IP Address on the scripts, and we can input IP Addressess on "devices.txt"
It just a simple script and maybe can help some people to get the basis of it.
Hope this help. Thanks.
